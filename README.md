# Note Taker
This app allows a user to track personal transactions. Each transaction is added to the table and the graph below tracking income and expense over time (or, more precisely, over number of transactions) is adjusted.

The purpose of this project was to create an Express.js back end for the app that saves and retreives note data from a JSON file.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* Express.js
